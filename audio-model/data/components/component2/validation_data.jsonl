She saw her dentist in Sacaton before Thanksgiving who placed her on antibiotics and told her to return to the clinic for multiple teeth extractions.  The patient neglected to return to the dentist until this weekend for IV antibiotics and definitive treatment.  She noticed on Friday that her face was starting to swell up a little bit and it progressively got worse.  The patient was admitted to the hospital on Monday for IV antibiotics.  Oral surgery was consulted today to aid in the management of the increased facial swelling and tooth pain.  The patient was worked up preoperatively by anesthesia and Oromaxillary Facial Surgery.  It was determined that she would benefit from being having multiple teeth removed and drainage of the facial abscess under general anesthesia.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on the operating room table on supine fashion.  ASA monitors were attached as stated.  General anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with a nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual oromaxillary facial surgery fashion.,An 18-gauze needle of 20 mL syringe was used to aspirate the pus out of the right buccal space.  This pus was then cultured and sent to micro lab for cultures and sensitivities.  Approximately 7 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:1000 epinephrine was injected in the maxillary vestibule and palate.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take affect a moist latex sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to throat pack throughout the case.  Mouth rinse was then poured into the oral cavity.  The mucosa was scrubbed with a tooth brush and peridex was evacuated with suction.  Using a #15 blade a clavicular incision from tooth #5 back to 1 with tuberosity release was performed.,A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed and approximately 6 mL of pus was instantly drained from the buccal space.  It was noted on exam that the tooth #1 was fractured off to the gum line with gross decay.  Tooth #2, 3, 4, and 5 had pus leaking from the clavicular epithelium and had rampant decay on tooth #2 and 3 and some mobility on teeth #4 and 5.  It was decided that teeth #1 through 5 would be surgically removed to ensure that all potential teeth causing the abscess were removed.  Using a rongeur both buccal bone and the tooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were surgically removed.  The extraction sites were curetted with curettes and the bone was smoothed with the rongeur and the bone file.  Dissection was then carried further up in the canine space and the face was palpated extra orally from the temporalis muscle down to the infraorbital rim and more pus was expressed.  This site was then irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water.  There was still noted to be induration in the buccal mucosa so #15 blade was used anterior to Stensen duct.  A 2 cm incision was made and using a Hemostat blunt dissection in to the buccal mucosa was performed.  A little-to-no pus was received.  Using a half-inch Penrose the drain was placed up on the anterior border of the maxilla and zygoma and sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon suture.  Remainder of the flap was left open to drain.  Further examination of the floor of mouth was soft.  The lateral pharynx was nonindurated or swollen.  At this point, the throat pack was removed and OG tube was placed and the stomach contents were evacuated.  The procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transferred to the PACU in excellent condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: dentistry, cultures, buccal, teeth, canine, pacu, teeth extractions, oromaxillary facial, facial surgery, buccal space, throat pack, buccal mucosa, surgical removal, canine's base, necrotic teeth, cpt code, infection, oral, surgery, mucosa, anesthesia, facial, pus, toothache, \nDescription:  Right buccal and canine's base infection from necrotic teeth.

The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.  The patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some.  His vital signs remain stable.  His blood pressure on discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3.  PPD was negative.  An SMS form was filled out in plan for his discharge and he was sent with medications that he had been receiving while here at Promise.,The patient and his family understood our plan and agreed with it.  He thanked us for the care that he received at Promise and thought that they did a fantastic job taking care of him.  He did not have any acute questions as to where he was going and what the next step of his care would be, but we did discuss this at length prior to date of discharge.,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: discharge summary, end-stage renal disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hospitalization, hemodialysis and rehab, hemodialysis \nDescription:  The patient is being discharged for continued hemodialysis and rehab."}]}

A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.,The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised.  There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal.  Upon dissection there, we did not find any hernias; however, he did have a fairly sizable hydrocele.  We went down towards the external ring and found that this was indeed tight without any hernias.,We then closed up the external oblique fascia and made an incision after doing a shave on the right and left scrotum into the upper scrotal sac with a curvilinear incision with a 15-blade knife.  We then extended down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The hydrocele sac was visualized and then drained after incising into it with a curved Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis was then delivered and found to have a moderate amount of scar tissue with a calcified appendix testis, which was then excised and sent to pathology.

We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic and placed the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then used an ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation on both incisional areas with 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine; 15 mL was given.,We performed a similar procedure on the left, incising it at the scrotal area first, rather than below, and found this tunica vaginalis, and dissected it in a similar fashion and cauterized the appendix testis, which was not torsed.  This was a smaller hydrocele, but because of the __________ shunt, we went up above and found that there was a very small connection, which was then dissected off the cord structures gently, twisted upon itself, suture ligated with a 2-0 Vicryl suture.,The ilioinguinal nerve block and other wound instillations again with 15 mL total of 0.25% Marcaine were then done by the surgeon as well.  The external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 2-0 Vicryl.  4-0 chromic was then used to close the Scarpa fascia.  The skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  The scrotal incisions were closed with a subcutaneous and dartos closure using 4-0 chromic.

Refractory voiding dysfunction.,3.  Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal with epidural.,INDICATIONS:  ,This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic \"pop,\" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: urology, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, omental pedicle flap, ligasure, gia, stapler, gia stapler, vicryl sutures, radiation therapy, silk sutures, bladder, therapy, sutures, endotracheal, \nDescription:  Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis."}]}

The adhesion was taken down, and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis.  The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor.  Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis, and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue.  Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall.  All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips.  The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: , Stable.,HISTORY OF PROCEDURE:,  This patient is well known to our service.  He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control.  The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident.  Although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi.  No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed.  Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded.  Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed.  A sterile drape around that was also placed.  The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.  A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.  The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula.  The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used.  Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein.  All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.  The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port.  These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions.  Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port.  Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed.  Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.  The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.  This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.  This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells.  Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.  Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed.  The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler.  Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified.  Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified.  Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.  These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.  The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe.  A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.  Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port.  Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package.  Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken.  The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.  A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.  Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again.  Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: cardiovascular / pulmonary, middle lobe, endogia, fiberoptic, mediastinal lymph node, vats, bronchoscopy, chest tube, chest wall, endotracheal tube, endotracheally, lobectomy, lung cancer, pneumonitis, sampling, thoracostomy, utility port, lumen endotracheal tube, superior pulmonary vein, chest wall lesions, anterior chest wall, middle lobectomy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, anterior chest, lymph node, node, port, chest, bronchus, tumor, pulmonary, incision,\nDescription:  VATS right middle lobectomy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, mediastinal lymph node sampling, tube thoracostomy x2, multiple chest wall biopsies and excision of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor."}]}

The patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  The patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  The patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  The patient has been on IV antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,After an IV was started by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  A restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of Webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the Department of Anesthesia.  After adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  The foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was elevated and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  Using Band-Aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,Using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  Using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  Then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  Care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  After cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  The head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  Attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  All remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  Areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  Due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, I thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  Therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  Deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  This was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  Following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  The wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using Kling and Kerlix and an ACE bandage to provide compression.  The tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  The ACE bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  Sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  The patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.

The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine.  Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel.  Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted.  Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat.  Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament.  Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal.  The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats.  It was a sliding indirect hernia.  The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base.  The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen.  This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon.

He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient\u2019s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient\u2019s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  The patient\u2019s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103.

Additionally, there was a notable liver cyst.  The remainder of the abdomen remained free of any adhesions.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 66-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.  The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stones were visualized.  Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This was also taken and sent off as specimen.  The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  The abdomen was de-insufflated.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  All incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures.  The areas were cleaned and dried.  Steri-Strips were placed.  On the incisions, sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following procedure.  She is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with Dr. X within one week for a follow-up evaluation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: gastroenterology, excision of liver cyst, gallbladder, omentum, cystic artery, gallstone, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, liver cyst, liver, abdomen, electrocautery, cholelithiasis, cholecystectomy, adhesions, laparoscopic, cyst, cystic, \nDescription:  Chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and liver cyst.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, double lumen endotracheal, en bloc resection, malignant mesothelioma, lung mass, endotracheal tube, chest tube, bovie cautery, en bloc, diaphragm, lobectomy, mesothelioma, thoracotomy, \nDescription:  Right nodular malignant mesothelioma."}]}

LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.  Of note, the patient received Angiomax during the procedure and an ACT above 300 was maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.,2.  High complex percutaneous coronary intervention of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal with Impella circulatory support.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The estimated blood loss was 200 ml.  Estimated dye used was 200 ml of Visipaque.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins.,PLAN:  ,1.  Aspirin, Plavix, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors as tolerated.,2.  Hydration.,3.  The patient will be observed over night for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia.

Bilateral orbital frontal zygomatic craniotomy (skull base approach).,2.  Bilateral orbital advancement with (C-shaped osteotomies down to the inferior orbital rim) with bilateral orbital advancement with bone grafts.,3.  Bilateral forehead reconstruction with autologous graft.,4.  Advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.,5.  Barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped with ChloraPrep.  Incision was infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A bicoronal zigzag incision was made and Raney clips used for hemostasis.  Subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  These were subgaleal flaps.  Bipolar and Bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  The craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  The pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy.,Paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  One was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  Also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  There was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes.,The dura was separated with a #4 Penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  I should say with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  Great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  Bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,The next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  Osteotomies were made with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  This was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  Midas Rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  The osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  Bone wax was used for hemostasis.  It was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  So we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  This was done with the Midas Rex drill using B5 bit.  Also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the Midas Rex drill.  The osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  At this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally.,Dr. X cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and I fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  This created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  The posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly.,The left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place.,Holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a Synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for Isaac.,At this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the Bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  This helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region.,Also, I separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly.,At this point, Gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure.,The wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  Bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with Bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 mL and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma.,At this point, the reconstruction looked good.  The advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  The wound was irrigated and then the Gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.

She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.

Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.

He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.,He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.,With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.,DRUG HISTORY:,  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.

The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2.

In addition, pilocarpine 1% was placed into the operative eye, two times, separated by 10 minutes.  The patient was wheeled to the operating suite where the anesthesia team established peripheral monitoring lines.  Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were administered.  The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva.  Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant.  Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness.  This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade.  The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.  A trabeculectomy was done and then the tube was threaded through the trabeculectomy site.  The tube was sutured in place with a multi-wrapped 8-0 nylon suture.  The scleral flap was then sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed, rotated and buried.  A scleral patch was then placed of an appropriate size over the two.  It was sutured in place with interrupted 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture with a BV needle.  The anterior chamber was filled with Viscoat to keep it deep as the eye was somewhat soft.  A good flow was established with irrigation into the anterior chamber.  Homatropine, Econopred, and Vigamox drops were placed into the eye.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after removing the draping and the speculum.

Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.

She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.  The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: urology, testicular abscess, necrotic testes, orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, orchidopexy, hemiscrotum, testicular torsion, penrose drain, scrotal swelling, scrotal wall, testicle, torsion\nDescription:  Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy."}]}

She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002.  She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007.  She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0.  We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine.  Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes.  She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes.  She does experience some leakage with coughing.  She wears the pad on a daily basis.  She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.  With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time.  She reports no headaches at this time.  With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse.  In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs.  She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.  She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.  She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.  She does not use the cane at this time.  Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces.  She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car.,MEDICATIONS:,  Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5 mg in the morning, Spiriva once a day, Advair twice a day, Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, Os-Cal 500 mg once a day, multivitamin once a day, and aspirin 81 mg a day.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On exam today, this is a pleasant 67-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area with little difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 1.0.,Mental Status:  Assessed and appears intact for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  Her Mini-Mental Status exam score was 26/30 when attention was tested with calculations and 30/30 when attention was tested with spelling.,Cranial Nerves:  Extraocular movements are somewhat inhibited.  She does not display any nystagmus at this time.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28.,ASSESSMENT:,  Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hydrocephalus.,2.  Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis.,3.  Neuropathy in the legs.,PLAN: , Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC.  We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus.  We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so.  We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one.

The patient states she has extreme pain with plantar fascitis in her left foot and has attempted conservative treatment including orthotics without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.  The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.  The patient is given postoperative pain prescriptions for Vicodin ES, one q3-4h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg one p.o. b.i.d.

Belly and back pain.  ,SUBJECTIVE: , Mr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Otherwise negative.,ALLERGIES: , No allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , No medications other than recent amoxicillin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Parents do smoke around the house.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.

On ultrasound, the uterus measured 14 cm x 6.5 cm x 7.8 cm.  She had received two dosage of Lupron to help shrink the fibroid.  Her most recent Pap smear was normal.,FINDINGS: , On a manual exam, the uterus is enlarged approximately 14 to 16 weeks size with multiple fibroids palpated.  On laparotomy, the uterus did have multiple pedunculated fibroids, the largest being approximately 7 cm.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.,There was evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus as well as the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There was some adhesions of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and as well as to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic was first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesions were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis was noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor was then placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was gently packed with moist laparotomy sponges and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus was then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament was identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat was passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl was used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostats were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl was then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion was tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area was entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament was suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This was then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum was then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap was taken down.  It was sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec was left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder was below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine arteries then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner was then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue was transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus was injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix was then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia was then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner was placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis was copiously irrigated.  There was a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder was tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl was placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligaments were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff was synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl was placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament was too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament was incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal areas were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap was reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis was again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue was placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There was no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again was allowed to drain.  All sponges were then removed and the bowel was allowed to return to its anatomical position.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec was removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick was used to assess any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There was no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.

The patient's symptoms have been persistent and had gotten worse with subjective weakness of the right upper extremity since its onset for several weeks now.  The patient has been treated with medications, which has been unrelenting.  The patient had imaging studies that showed evidence of cervical spondylosis with herniated disk and stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7.  The patient underwent liver surgery and postoperatively her main issue was that of some degree of on and off right shoulder pain and some operative site soreness, which was treated well with IV morphine.  The patient has resolution of the pain down the arm, but she does have some tingling of the right thumb and right index finger.  The patient apparently is doing well with slight dysphagia, we treated her with Decadron and we will send her home with Medrol.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips.  Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made.  Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct.  After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography.  The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery.  Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.,Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, intraoperative cholangiogram, cystic artery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, gallbladder, tonsil, cholecystectomy, cholangiogram, abdomen, laparoscopic, cannula,\nDescription:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with attempted intraoperative cholangiogram.

Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.

Carcinoid tumor of the small bowel.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Exploratory laparotomy, resection of small bowel lesion, biopsy of small bowel mesentery, bilateral extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy (including preaortic and precaval, bilateral common iliac, presacral, bilateral external iliac lymph nodes), salvage radical cystoprostatectomy (very difficult due to previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and continent urinary diversion with an Indiana pouch.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal and epidural.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 65-year-old white male, who was diagnosed with a high-grade invasive bladder cancer in June 2005.  During the course of his workup of transurethral resection, he had a heart attack when he was taken off Plavix after having had a drug-eluting stent placed in.  He recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event.  The patient has been followed regularly by myself and Dr. X and has been continuously free of diseases since that time.  In that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of Plavix.  Most recently, he had a PET CT, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated.  I took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer.  We could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed.  Metastatic workup was negative and Cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy.  He was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and I felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier.  Therefore, we planned on an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,On exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows:  There were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1.5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface.  There were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass.  The larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor.  There also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes.  The small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted.,Both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect; viability was unable to be determined.  There was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative.  The bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface.  The bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures.  The external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove that.  The rest of the large bowel appeared normal.  There were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent.  There was nasogastric tube in the stomach.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter.  Intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis.  We made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline.  Exploration was carried out with the findings described.  The bladder was adherent and did appear immobile.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure.  We began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described.  We subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two-layer running 4-0 Prolene suture.  We then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of Toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis.  The right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber.  I kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above.  At that point, we then ligated the ureters with the RP-45 vascular load and divided it.,We then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes.  The common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter.  Frozen section with the findings described on the left.,I then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally.  I was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels.  Clips were used to control the lymphatics distally.  These lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative.  We made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it.  The obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove those.  On the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact.,We then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that I can take these down.  I then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate.  At this point, I scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that I felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and I reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance.,I then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an RP-45 stapler on the right and clips distally.  The endopelvic fascia was incised.  I then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior Denonvilliers fascia.  I intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically.  I was able to pass a 0 Vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a LigaSure and oversewed it distally with 2-0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch.  I then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the Foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra.  I then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field.  The bivalved prostate appeared normal.  We then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact.  The wound was irrigated with 1 L of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic \"pop,\" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,The stoma was returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum.,We then placed a large JP drain into both obturator fossae and brought it up the right lower quadrant.  Rectus fascia was closed with buried #2 Prolene stitch anchoring a new figure of 8 at each end tying the two stitches above and in the middle and underneath the fascia.  Interrupted stitches were placed as well.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and skin closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 2500 mL.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.

Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: neurology, epidural hematoma, cervical spine, cervical laminectomy, central cord syndrome, acute quadriplegia, insertion of epidural drain, epidural drain, epidural space, hematoma, epidural, cervical, laminectomy, quadriplegia, \nDescription:  Evacuation of epidural hematoma and insertion of epidural drain.

Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The ventral chordee tissue was removed.  We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee.  In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen.  We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis.  Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight.  The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it.  We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade.  We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect.  We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors.  We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty.  Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans.  We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures.  We then closed the ventral defect.  Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place.

The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.

Fractured and retained lumbar subarachnoid spinal catheter.,2.  Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension).,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  L1 laminotomy.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  Retrieval of foreign body (retained lumbar spinal catheter).,4.  Attempted insertion of new external lumbar drain.,5.  Fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,The patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  All went well with the surgery.  The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, laminotomy, microdissection, lumbar spinal catheter, external lumbar drain, fluoroscopy, lumbar subarachnoid, spinal catheter, intracranial hypertension, vicryl interrupted sutures, lumbar, catheter, \nDescription:   L1 laminotomy, microdissection, retrieval of foreign body (retained lumbar spinal catheter), attempted insertion of new external lumbar drain, and fluoroscopy."}]}

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia.

The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.

Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.

There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.  ,The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. ,The lung bases are clear. ,Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.

Since then she just says \"things have changed\".  She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel \"like cramps\" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of \"falling\", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.

Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.,2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.

The bowel, omentum, and appendix had a normal appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.

The patient has a history of chronic ulceration to the right foot which has been treated on an outpatient basis with conservative methods Dr. X.  At this time, he desires surgical correction as the ulcer has been refractory to conservative treatment.  Incidentally, the ulcer is noninfective and practically healed at this date.  The consent is available on the chart for review and Dr. X has discussed the risks versus benefits of this procedure to the patient in detail.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across his waist for his protection.  A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right foot over copious amount of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were administered into the right fifth metatarsal using a Mayo type block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operating field and a sterile stockinet was reflected.  The Betadine was cleansed with saline-soaked gauze and dried.  Anesthesia was tested with a one tooth pickup and found to be adequate.  A #10 blade was used to make 3.5 cm linear incision over the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  Care was taken to retract the extensor digitorum longus tendon medially and the abductor digiti minimi tendon laterally.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the medial and lateral edges of the wound were undermined down to the level of the capsule and deep fascia.  A linear capsular incision was made with a #15 blade down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade.  Metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  There was hypertrophic exostosis noted laterally as well as a large bursa in the subcuteneous tissue layer.  The ulcer on the skin was approximately 2 x 2 mm, it was partial skin thickness and did not probe.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the hypertrophic lateral eminence.  The hypertrophic bone was split in half and one half was sent to Pathology and the other half was sent to Microbiology for culture and sensitivity.  Next, a reciprocating rasp was used to smoothen all bony surfaces.  The bone stock had an excellent healthy appearance and did not appear to be infected.  Copious amount of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline were used to flush the wound.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress suture technique.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Betadine-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Kling.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  He was given a postop shoe and will be full weightbearing.  He has prescription already at home for hydrocodone and does not need to refill.  He is to follow up with Dr. X and was given emergency contact numbers.

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.

A right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  A sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  The patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  A percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using Seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  After satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  After the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  A cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  The wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the Swan-Ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  Cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  The right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  First, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture.  The pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 Prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 Prolene.  The arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  Air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  The clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  Blood factors and factor VII were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  Because of excessive transfusions that were required, a Mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the Mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  Hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  After he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with Ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  The patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  This was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor VII.  Urine output for the procedure was 520 mL.  The preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  The estimated blood loss was at least 6 L.

The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.

The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.

Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month.

She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.

He is hemodynamically stable on heparin and Integrilin bolus and infusion was initiated.  The right femoral area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 2 mL was then filled locally.  The right femoral artery was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by a 6-French vascular sheath.  A guiding catheter XB 3.5 was advanced in manipulated to cannulate the left coronary artery and angiography was obtained.  A confirmed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with minimal collaterals and also occlusion of the right coronary artery, which is well collateralized.  An angioplasty wire with present wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery, and could cross the area of occlusion within the stent.  An angioplasty balloon measuring 2.0 x 15 was advanced and three inflations were obtained.  It successfully re-canalized the artery.  There is evidence of residual stenosis within the distal aspect of the previous stents.  A drug-eluting stent Xience 2.75 x 15 was advanced and positioned within the area of stenosis with its distal marker adjacent to bifurcation with a diagonal branch and was deployed at 12 and 18 atmospheres.  The intermittent result was improved.  An additional inflation was obtained more proximally.  His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation.  There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow.  The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve.  The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath.  A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.

The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.

She was placed on the operating table in seated position.  Her head was shaved.  Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken.  The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint.  Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.,The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit.  At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill.  The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  Microelectrode recording was then performed.  The signatures of the cells were recognized.  Microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  The microelectrode unit was then remounted.  Microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  The arc was then removed.  A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used.  Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  Sterile dressings were applied.

Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.

The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.

His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee.\" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him \"bitch.\" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to \"deal with it.\",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.

Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: consult - history and phy., muscle tremor, headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, independent medical evaluation, psychopharmacologic, poor ability to focus, major depressive disorder, tremor, depressive, psychiatric, \nDescription:  Patient presented with significant muscle tremor, constant headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, and poor ability to focus."}]}

These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.

Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today\u2019s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday\u2019s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.

He is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease.,NARRATIVE:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2% lidocaine.  Constant sedation was obtained using Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  Received additional Versed and fentanyl during the procedure.  Please refer to the nurses' notes for dosages and timing.,The right femoral artery was entered and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta.  Via the right Judkins catheter, the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch.  The right Judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  This revealed a very high-grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery.  This catheter was exchanged for a left #4 Judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.,The patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  A 6-French sheath and a right Judkins guide was placed.  The patient was started on bivalarudin.  A BMW wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  A 3.0 x 15 mm Voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  The intermediate result was improved with TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  Following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm Xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  This revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  This was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  Final angiograms revealed excellent result with TIMI-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  The guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  This was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  The catheter was removed.  The bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  A small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and Angio-Seal was placed without incident.,It should also be noted that an 8-French sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  This was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea.,Total contrast media, 205 mL, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, X-ray dose, 2666 milligray.,HEMODYNAMICS: , Rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  Aortic pressure was 170/81 mmHg.,The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  This vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small RV free wall branches and PDA and a small left ventricular branch.  It should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  In the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  After intervention, there is TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  There was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis.,The left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the LAD and the circumflex.  The ramus intermedius is free of disease.  The LAD terminates at the LV apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  This measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  There is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  Distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the AV groove.,The aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  This may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  There was some dye hang up in the wall.,IMPRESSION,1.  Successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.,2.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.

Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.

The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.

It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.

The patient had tried nonoperative therapy, which did not assist the patient.  The patient had previous diagnosis of carpal tunnel and EMG showed compression of the right median nerve.  As a result of these findings, the patient was sent to my office presenting with this history and was carefully evaluated.  On initial evaluation, the patient had the symptomology of carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient at the time had the risks, benefits, and alternatives thoroughly explained to her.  All questions were answered.  No guarantees were given.  The patient had agreed to the surgical procedure and the postoperative rehabilitation as needed.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given sedation.  The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, carpal tunnel syndrome, ace wrap, emg, freer elevator, kerlix, weitlaner retractor, bulky dressing, carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel release, palmar fascia, subcutaneous fat, lidocaine with epinephrine, transverse carpal ligament, carpal ligament, carpal, tunnel, ligament,\nDescription:  Right carpal tunnel release."}]}

He was initially taken to Hospital.  CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  He has been seen by Hospitalists Service.  He has not had a recurrent seizure.  Electroencephalogram shows slowing.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  All details are still not available to us.  He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic.  That is not available on the chart as I dictate.,After discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and Dr. Z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  He tolerated that reasonably well.  His wife says it's been several years since he had a scan.  His behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had a lumbar fusion.  I believe he's had heart disease.  Mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  He has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , No headaches or vision issues.  Ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  No weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  No history of endocrine problems.  He has nocturia and urinary frequency.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears, nose, throat normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest clear.  Heart tones normal.  Abdomen soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  Neurologically alert.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.,LABORATORY WORK: , White blood count 10.4, hemoglobin 16, platelets not noted.  Sodium 137, calcium 9.1.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Likely recurrent low-grade tumor, possibly evolved to a higher grade, given the MRI and SPECT findings.  Dr. X's note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on Wednesday.  He is stable enough.  The pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  It would be helpful to get old films and pathology from Abbott Northwestern.  However, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.  Optimizing his treatment would probably be helped by knowing his current grade of tumor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: consult - history and phy., spect, electroencephalogram, middle cerebral artery, brain tumor, inhomogeneous, frontotemporal, neoplasm, recurrent\nDescription:  The patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state.

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura.

The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency.  Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed.  Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc.  Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed.  Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.  The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.,The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months.  The patient understood.

Posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots.,IMPLANT: , Sofamor Danek (Medtronic) Legacy 5.5 Titanium system.,MONITORING: , SSEPs, and the EPs were available.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 12-year-old female, who has had a very dysmorphic scoliosis.  She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, osteotomy, laminotomy-foraminotomy, sofamor danek, sseps, spinal fusion, transverse processes, pedicle hooks, pedicle, laminotomy, hooks, screws, instrumentation, decompression, scoliosis, sofamor, foraminotomy, spinal\nDescription:  Posterior spinal fusion and spinal instrumentation.

Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stent.,NARRATIVE:,  After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography was recorded.  Next, the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressures were measured.  LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram was done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip was started.  Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pass the stent.  Next, second dilatations were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure was aborted.  Final images showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP was 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities.,3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.,4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.,5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal shows proximal 80% stenosis.,6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at its take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.,7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pass stents, noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon.  Final images showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.  Possible consideration would be a stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia, focus on treatment to that lesion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: cardiovascular / pulmonary, coronary system cineangiography, svg to om, lima to lad, ventriculogram, aortogram, percutaneous intervention, circumflex, obtuse marginal branch, balloon angioplasty, coronary artery, balloon, cineangiography, lad,\nDescription:  Left and right coronary system cineangiography, cineangiography of SVG to OM and LIMA to LAD.

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,\nDescription:  Cystoscopy under anesthesia, retrograde and antegrade pyeloureteroscopy, left ureteropelvic junction obstruction, difficult and open renal biopsy."}]}

Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: hematology - oncology, double lumen endotracheal, en bloc resection, malignant mesothelioma, lung mass, endotracheal tube, chest tube, bovie cautery, en bloc, diaphragm, lobectomy, mesothelioma, thoracotomy, \nDescription:  Right nodular malignant mesothelioma."}]}

The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.

A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

No adnexal masses, however, were appreciated on the bimanual exam.  Laparoscopically, the patient had numerous omental adhesions to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus.  There were also adhesions to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube.  There was a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liters of clotted and unclotted blood.  There was some questionable gestational tissue ________ on the left sacrospinous ligament.  There was an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube.,PROCEDURE:,  After an informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the vagina.  The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank and then a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue was then sent to pathology.  At this point, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was then turned to the abdomen.  The surgeons all are removed the dirty gloves in the previous portion of the case.  Next, a 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Next, a syringe was used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle.  The normal saline was seen to drop freely, so a Veress needle was connected to the CO2 gas which was started at its lowest setting.  The gas was seen to flow freely with normal resistance, so the CO2 gas was advanced to a higher setting.  The abdomen was insufflated to an adequate distension.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  The introducer was removed and the trocar was connected to the CO2 gas and a camera was inserted.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadths below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera.  A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #5 trocar was inserted under direct visualization.  Next a size #5 port was placed approximately five fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion.  A size #12 port was placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization.  The laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the suprapubic port and this was used to dissect the omental adhesions bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes.  Next, the Dorsey suction irrigator was used to copiously irrigate the abdomen.  Approximate total of 3 liters of irrigation was used and the majority of all blood clots and free blood was removed from the abdomen.,Once the majority of blood was cleaned from the abdomen, the ectopic pregnancy was easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube was grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device was then inserted through the right upper quadrant with # 12 port.  Three bites with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy.  An EndoCatch bag was then placed to the size #12 port and this was used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy.  This was then sent to the pathology.  Next, the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic.  The abdomen was further irrigated.  The liver was examined and appeared to be within normal limits.  At this point, the two size #5 ports and a size #12 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was then removed.  The CO2 gas was disconnected and the abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced in a size #11 port and the whole port and introducer was removed as a single unit.  All laparoscopic incisions were closed with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  They were then steri-stripped and bandaged appropriately.  At the end of the procedure, the uterine manipulator was removed from the cervix and the patient was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She was discharged home with a postoperative hemoglobin of 8.9.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.

She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: cardiovascular / pulmonary, hypokalemia, shortness of breath, atrial tachycardia, sinus rhythm, hip fracture, atrial, tachycardia, rhythm, apcs, cardiac, regurgitation, aortic, hypertension, pulmonary, \nDescription:  An 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation."}]}

She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.

Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: neurology, ama guide, evaluation of permanent impairment, impairment rating, permanent impairment, suprascapular nerve, suprascapular neuropathy, injured, extremity, shoulder, impairment, neuropathy, suprascapular,\nDescription:  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy."}]}

The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.

She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.

The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: nephrology, infected stent, cysto stent removal, cysto stent, renal stone, lower pole, infected, stone, stent, cysto,\nDescription:  Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.

A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.

Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage\nDescription:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.

An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator.  The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent.  Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1.  The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11.  A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body.,Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1.  Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body.,At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur.  It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12.,At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur.  There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space.  Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1.  These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur.  Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  It was felt that distraction was not necessary.  A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture.  The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.

X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.

Capsular shift, left shoulder (Mitek suture anchors; absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures).,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have chronic instability of her shoulder.  Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed in length including but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, continued instability, recurrent instability, medical complications, surgical complications, and anesthesia complications.  The patient understood and wishes to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Anterior instability, left shoulder.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:,1.  Anterior instability, left shoulder.,2.  Grade 4 chondromalacia, 10% humeral head, chondral defect 1 cm squared, left shoulder.,3.  Type 1 superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder.,4.  Anteroinferior glenoid erosions 10% bony surface, left shoulder.,5.  Bankart lesion, left shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and both shoulders examined systematically.  She had full range of motion with no joint adhesions.  She had equal range of motion bilaterally.  She had Hawkins 2 anteriorly and posteriorly in both shoulders with a grade 1 sulcus sign in both shoulders.  This was the same when the arm was in neutral or in external rotation.  The patient was then turned to right lateral decubitus position, axillary roll was placed, and beanbag was inflated.  Peroneal nerve was well protected.  All bony prominences were well protected.,The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was given antibiotics well before the start of the procedure to decrease the risk of infection.  The arm was placed in a arm holder with 10 pounds of traction.  A posterior portal was created in the usual manner by isolating gently with the spinal needle, it was insufflated with 30 cubic centimeters of saline.  A small incision was made after infiltrating the skin with Marcaine and epinephrine.  The scope was introduced into the shoulder with no difficulty.  It was then examined systematically.  The patient did have diffuse synovitis throughout her shoulder.  Her posterior humeral head showed an enlarged bold spot with some other areas of chondromalacia on the posterior head.  She also had an area 1 cm in diameter, which was on more central portion of the head and more inferiorly which appeared to be more of an impaction-type injury.  This had some portions of fibrillated and loose cartilage, hanging from the edges.  These were later debrided, but the dissection was proximally 10 to 15% of the humeral surface.,The biceps tendon appeared to be normal.  The supraspinatus, infraspinatus tendons were normal.  The inferior pouch was normal with no capsular tearing and no HAGL lesions.  The posteroinferior labrum was normal as well as the posterosuperior labrum.  There was some fraying in the posterosuperior labrum, which was later debrided.  It was found essentially to be a type 1 lesion anteriorly and superiorly.  The anterosuperior labrum appeared to be detached, which appeared to be more consistent with a sublabral hole.  The middle glenohumeral ligament was present as an entire sheath, but attach to the labrum.  The labrum did appeared to be detached from the anterior glenoid from the 11 o'clock position all the way down to the 6 o'clock position.  The biceps anchor itself was later probed and found to be stable and normal.  The subscapularis tendon was normal.  The anterior band of the glenohumeral ligament was present, but it was clearly avulsed off the glenoid.  There was some suggestion of anteroinferior bony erosions, which was later substantiated when the shoulder was opened.  The patient was missing about 10 to 15% of her anteroinferior glenoid rim.  The patient had a positive drive-through sign.,The arm was then moved to lateral and placed through range of motion.  There was contact of the rotator cuff to the superior glenoid in flexion at 115 degrees, maximum flexion was 150 degrees.  The arm abducted and externally rotated.  There was contact to the rotator cuff with posterosuperior labrum.  This occurred with the arm position of 90 degrees with abduction at 55 degrees of external rotation.  It should be noted that the maximum abduction is 150 degrees and with the arm abducted 90 degrees, maximum external rotation was 95 degrees.  The patient did have a positive relocation maneuver.  The posterior labrum did appear to tilt-off, but did not appear to peel off.,The arm was then placed back in the arm holder.  Anterior portal was created with Wissinger rod.  A blue cannula was inserted into the shoulder without difficulty.  Shaver was introduced in the labrum.  Also the area of chondromalacia as mentioned above was debrided.  The labrum was found to be stable with only a type 1 SLAP lesion, and there was no evidence as there was really a type 2 SLAP lesion.  The instruments were then removed along with excess fluid.  The posterior portals were closed with single 4-0 nylon suture.  The anterior portal was left open.  The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the extremity was reprepped and draped in anticipation of performing open capsular shift.,The patient's anterior incision made just lateral to the coracoid in the skin line.  Mediolateral skin flaps were developed, and cephalic vein was identified and protected throughout the case.  The interval was developed down the clavipectoral fascia.  The conjoined tendon was retracted medially and the deltoid laterally.  The patient's subscapularis was intact, and the subscapularis split was then made between the upper one half and lower one half in line with muscle fibers.  The capsule could easily be detached from the muscle, and the interval developed very easily.  A retractor was placed inferiorly to protect the axillary nerve.  Then Gelpi retractor was used to hold the subscapularis split open.,Next, an arthrotomy was made down at the 9 o'clock position.  The labrum was identified and found to be attached all the way down to 6 o'clock position.  The inferior flap was then created in a usual manner and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture.  The patient's glenoid rim did have some erosion as mentioned above with some bone loss and flattening.  This was debrided with the soft tissue.  Three Mitek suture anchors were then placed into the glenoid rim right at the margin of articular cartilage to the scapular neck.  These were absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures.  They had excellent fixation once they had been placed.,Next, the capsular shift and Bankart repair were performed in the usual manner with the number 2 Ti-Cron sutures as an outside in and then inside out technique.  This brought the capsule right up to the edge of the glenoid rim.  With the arm in internal rotation and posterior pressure on the head, the capsule was then secured to the rim with no difficulty under direct visualization.  The capsule did come right up into the joint as expected with this type of repair.  The superior flap was then closed, the inferior flap over the superior anchor.  The interval between two flaps was closed with multiple number 2 Ti-Cron sutures.  Once this has been completed, there was no tension on the repair with the arm to side until 10 degrees of external rotation was reached.  The arm abducted 90 degrees.  There was tension on the repair until 20 degrees of external rotation reached.,The wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic-impregnated irrigation.  The subscapularis split was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with number 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Prolene, reinforced with Steri-Strips.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer.

The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy, discectomy, nerve root, lumbar laminectomy, herniated nucleus, thecal sac, spinal needle, nucleus pulposus, disc space, root, nerve, weakness, lumbar, laminectomy, nucleus, pulposus, myelogram\nDescription:  Injection for myelogram and microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left.

There was no way to perform same procedure there, so what I did, I took an electric saw and proceeded to divide the calcified cartilages of the sternum and also the attachments to the lower ribs.  There was also a separate sharp growth of the mass growing superiorly.  Apparently, I was able to excise the mass and actually it was much larger than it was palpated externally.  This may be due to an extension towards the inside of his chest.  Hemostasis was revised.  The internal mammary was intact and there was no obvious penetration of the pleural cavity.  The specimen was sent to Pathology and then we proceeded to close the defect.  Obviously, the space between the ribs cannot be approximated.

The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.

Lumbar laminectomy for decompression with foraminotomies L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 microtechniques.,2.  Repair of CSF fistula, microtechniques L5-S1, application of DuraSeal.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has about a four-month history now of urinary incontinence and numbness in her legs and hands, and difficulty ambulating.  She was evaluated with an MRI scan, which showed a very high-grade stenosis in her lumbar spine, and subsequent evaluation included a myelogram, which demonstrated cervical stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 as well as a complete block of the contrast at L4-L5 and no contrast at L5-S1 either and stenosis at L3-L4 and all the way up, but worse at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  Yesterday, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7 and had some improvement of her symptoms and increased strength, even in the recovery room.  She was kept in the ICU because of her age and the need to bring her back to the operating room today for decompressive lumbar laminectomy.  The rationale for putting the surgery is close together that she is normally on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, though she has been cardioverted.  She and her son understand the nature, indications, and risks of the surgery, and agreed to go ahead.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought from the Neuro ICU to the operating room, where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was rolled in a prone position on the Wilson frame.  The back was prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak, followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the usual anatomical landmarks, linear midline incision was made presumed over L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue, then Bovie electrocautery was used to isolate the spinous processes.  A Kocher clamp was placed in the anterior spinous ligament and this turned out to be L5-S1.  The incision was extended rostrally and deep Gelpi's were inserted to expose the spinous processes and lamina of L3, L4, L5, and S1.  Using the Leksell rongeur, the spinous processes of L4 and L5 were removed completely, and the caudal part of L3.  A high-speed drill was then used to thin the caudal lamina of L3, all of the lamina of L4 and of L5.  Then using various Kerrison punches, I proceeded to perform a laminectomy.  Removing the L5 lamina, there was a dural band attached to the ligamentum flavum and this caused about a 3-mm tear in the dura.  There was CSF leak.  The lamina removal was continued, ligamentum flavum was removed to expose all the dura.  Then using 4-0 Nurolon suture, a running-locking suture was used to close the approximate 3-mm long dural fistula.  There was no CSF leak with Valsalva.,I then continued the laminectomy removing all of the lamina of L5 and of L4, removing the ligamentum flavum between L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Foraminotomies were accomplished bilaterally.  The caudal aspect of the lamina of L3 also was removed.  The dura came up quite nicely.  I explored out along the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots after completing the foraminotomies, the roots were quite free.  Further more, the thecal sac came up quite nicely.  In order to ensure no CSF leak, we would follow the patient out of the operating room.  The dural closure was covered with a small piece of fat.  This was all then covered with DuraSeal glue.  Gelfoam was placed on top of this, then the muscle was closed with interrupted 0 Ethibond.  The lumbodorsal fascia was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 0 Ethibond in a watertight fashion.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running 0 Vicryl, and finally the skin was closed with a running-locking 3-0 nylon.  The wound was blocked with 0.5% plain Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Estimated blood loss for the case was about 100 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS:  Correct.,FINDINGS:  A very tight high-grade stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.

This appeared to be of adequate length to transpose the vein through the subcutaneous tissue to an old occluded fistula vein, which remains patent through a small collateral vein.  A transverse skin incision was made over the superior aspect of the old fistula vein.  This vein was carefully dissected out and encircled with vascular tapes.  The brachial vein was then tunneled in a gentle curve above the bicep to the level of the cephalic vein fistula.  The patient was sensible, was then systemically heparinized.

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.

The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.

A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  There was good blood return from both the ports.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.,Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  Patent foramen ovale.,INTERVENTION: , Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.

General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.

Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.

At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords:  \nDescription:  Open Stamm gastrotomy tube, lysis of adhesions, and closure of incidental colotomy"}]}

The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure.  With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand.

The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2.  Cavitation was achieved.,LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS:,  With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal.  Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver.  Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature.  Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver.  The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time).  This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity.  Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance.,With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc.  The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished.  Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees.  This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally.  These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity.,By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, fibromyositis, myalgia, segmental dysfunction, sacro-iliitis, spinal manipulation under anesthesia, lumbar segmental dysfunction, informed consent, iliac joints, spinal manipulation, sacro iliitis, lower extremity, spinal, mua, cephalad, dysfunction, segmental, lumbar, \nDescription:  Spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia - Sacro-iliitis, lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction, thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction, associated with myalgia/fibromyositis."}]}

It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.

The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis.  Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery.  The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia.  The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.,The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  After the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.,The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.

She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.

Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.

A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.

At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.

These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.

There is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study.  For the time being, sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a full-night sleep.  She is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help.  We also discussed as before weight loss and exercise, which could be helpful.,4.

The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation.  The procedure is discussed below.,I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition.  She was placed on the operating table in seated position.  Her head was shaved.  Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken.  The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint.  Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.,The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit.  At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill.  The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  Microelectrode recording was then performed.  The signatures of the cells were recognized.  Microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  The microelectrode unit was then remounted.  Microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  The arc was then removed.  A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used.  Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The Leksell arc was then removed.,She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.

Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.

Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.  Blood clots were evacuated from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.,Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.

Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stent.,NARRATIVE:,  After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography was recorded.  Next, the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressures were measured.  LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram was done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip was started.  Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pass the stent.  Next, second dilatations were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure was aborted.  Final images showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP was 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities.,3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.,4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.,5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal shows proximal 80% stenosis.,6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at its take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.,7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pass stents, noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon.  Final images showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.

The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: gastroenterology, abdomen, bovie cautery, endotracheal anesthesia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, chronic cholecystitis, abdominal, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cholecystitis, gallbladder, \nDescription:  Chronic cholecystitis.

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.

The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was \"under tapped\" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, degenerative disk disease, disk protrusions, spondylosis, radiculopathy, tlif, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusio, danek m8, intervertebral prosthetic device, danek capstone, matchstick burr, capstone, bmp, vertebral autograft, screws were placed bilaterally, pedicle screw, kerrison rongeurs, disk space, disk, spacers, kerrison, interbody, rongeurs, pedicle, lumbar, screws, \nDescription:  Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, placement of intervertebral prosthetic device."}]}

She has subsequently been on tamoxifen.  Ultrasound did show a thickened endometrial stripe as well as an adnexal cyst.  The above procedures were therefore performed.,FINDINGS:  ,On bimanual exam, the uterus was found to be slightly enlarged and anteverted.  The external genitalia was normal.  Hysteroscopic findings revealed both ostia well visualized and a large polyp on the anterolateral wall of the endometrium.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a normal-appearing uterus and normal left ovary.  There was no evidence of endometriosis on the ovaries bilaterally, the ovarian fossa, the cul-de-sac, or the vesicouterine peritoneum.  There was a cyst on the right ovary which appeared simple in nature.  The cyst was aspirated and the fluid was blood tinged.  Therefore, the decision to perform oophorectomy was made.  The liver margins appeared normal and there were no pelvic or abdominal adhesions noted.  The polyp removed from the hysteroscopic portion of the exam was found to be 4 cm in size.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the posterior vaginal vault in the 12 o'clock position and the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then sounded in the anteverted position to 10 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank and Hegar dilators up to a Hank dilator of 20 and Hagar dilator of 10.  The hysteroscope was then inserted and the above findings were noted.  A sharp curette was then introduced and the 4 cm polyp was removed.  The hysteroscope was then reinserted and the polyp was found to be completely removed at this point.  The polyp was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed as a means to manipulate the uterus.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Using a sterile saline drop test, appropriate placement was confirmed.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume inflow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was placed without difficulty.  The above findings were then visualized.  A 5 mm port was placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was done under direct visualization and the grasper was inserted through this port for better visualization.  A 12 mm port was then made in the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and the Endo-GIA was inserted through this port and the fallopian tube and ovary were incorporated across the infundibulopelvic ligament.  Prior to this, the cyst was aspirated using 60 cc syringe on a needle.  Approximately, 20 cc of blood-tinged fluid was obtained.  After the ovary and fallopian tube were completely transected, this was placed in an EndoCatch bag and removed through the lateral port site.  The incision was found to be hemostatic.  The area was suction irrigated.  After adequate inspection, the port sites were removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was desufflated.  The infraumbilical port site and laparoscope were also removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then injected locally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.

After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis.  At this point, we probed both urethral meatus.  Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus.  At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter.  We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful.  We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication.  At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors.  We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans.,At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee.

He was initially taken to Hospital.  CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  He has been seen by Hospitalists Service.  He has not had a recurrent seizure.  Electroencephalogram shows slowing.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  All details are still not available to us.  He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic.  That is not available on the chart as I dictate.,After discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and Dr. Z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  He tolerated that reasonably well.  His wife says it's been several years since he had a scan.  His behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had a lumbar fusion.  I believe he's had heart disease.  Mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  He has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , No headaches or vision issues.  Ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  No weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  No history of endocrine problems.  He has nocturia and urinary frequency.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears, nose, throat normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest clear.  Heart tones normal.  Abdomen soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  Neurologically alert.  Cranial nerves are intact.

Dr. X's note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on Wednesday.  He is stable enough.  The pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  It would be helpful to get old films and pathology from Abbott Northwestern.  However, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.

After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: cardiovascular / pulmonary, heart catheterization, coronary angiography, ventricular angiography, intercoronary stenting, intercoronary, coronary, stenting, stenosis, angiography\nDescription:  Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery."}]}

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.

Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.

He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.

Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra.  The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.

She had a recent D&C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.

The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.

The patient asked me about antibiotics and I did not see a need to do this since he did not appear to have an infection other than viral given his normal temperature, normal pulse, normal respiratory rate, and near normal oxygen.  The patient being on Coumadin I explained to him that unless there was a solid reason to put him on antibiotics, he would be advised not to do so because antibiotics can alter the gut floor causing the INR to increase while on Coumadin which may cause serious bleeding.  The patient understands this.  I then asked him if the cough was annoying him, he said it was.  I offered him a cough syrup, which he agreed to take.  The patient was then discharged with Tussionex Pennkinetic a hydrocodone time-release cough syrup.  I told to check in three days, if the symptoms were not getting better.  The patient appeared to be content with this treatment and was discharged in approximately 30 to 45 minutes later.  His wife calls me very angry that I did not give him antibiotics.  I explained her exactly what I explained to him that they were not indicative at this time, and she became very upset saying that they came there specifically for antibiotics and I explained again that antibiotics are not indicated for viral infection and that I did not think he had a bacterial infection.,DIAGNOSIS: , Viral respiratory illness."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: emergency room reports, sputum, short of breath, fever, chills, copd, emphysema, viral respiratory illness, green and grayish sputum, viral syndrome, respiratory rate, cough syrup, cough, antibiotics, inhaler,\nDescription:  This 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department for three days of cough, claims that he has brought up some green and grayish sputum.

He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.,GENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.  Pallor is improved.,EYES:  Conjunctivae are now pink.,ENT:  Oropharynx is clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.,LUNGS:  Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.,EXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: emergency room reports, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding\nDescription:  Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.

After systemic administration of alfentanil, local anesthetic was infiltrated into the left upper lid, left lateral canthus, and left lower eyelid.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic fashion.  Protective scleral shell was placed in the left eye.  A 4-0 silk traction sutures placed through the upper eyelid margin.  The medial aspect of the remaining lower eyelid was freshened with straight iris scissors and fibrin was removed from the inferior aspect of the wound.  The eyelid was everted and a tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap was developed by incision of the tarsus approximately 3-1/2-4 mm from the lid margin the full width of the eyelid.  Relaxing incisions were made both medially and laterally and Mueller's muscle was subsequently dissected free from the superior tarsal border.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then anchored to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and one 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The protective scleral shell was removed from the eye.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, cervical spondylosis, cervical fusion, decompression, instrumentation, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior cervical, herniated disc, cervical discectomy, anterior, cervical, fusion, allograft, discectomy\nDescription:  Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, anterior cervical fusion, anterior cervical instrumentation, and Allograft C5-C6."}]}

However, on exam unable to delineate the facial structures, but definite fetal malpresentation.  The fetal heart tones did start and it continued to have variable decelerations with contractions overall are reassuring.  The contraction pattern was inadequate.  It was discussed with the patient's family that in light of the physical exam and with the fetal malpresentation that a cesarean section will be recommended.  All the questions were answered.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with a leftward tilt.  Prior to this, the spinal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was then prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was then grasped with Ochsners, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The superior portion and inferior portion of the rectus fascia was identified, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was then identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then gently stretched.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with an Allis and the bladder flap was created bluntly as well as using Metzenbaum scissors.  The uterus was entered with the second scalpel and large transverse incision.  This was then extended in upward and lateral fashion bluntly.  The infant was then delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were suctioned.  The cord was then clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  The placenta was then manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then repaired using #0 chromic in a running fashion marking a U stitch.  A second layer of the same suture was used in an imbricating fashion to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was then returned to the anatomical position.  The abdomen and the gutters were cleared of all clots.  Again, the incision was found to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The rectus fascia was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion locking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  This was palpated and the patient was found to be without defect and intact.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.

The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.

He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.

Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.

Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, hammertoe deformity, arthroplasty, digit, proximal interphalangeal joint, periosteal tissue, interrupted sutures, interphalangeal joint, proximal phalanx, proximal, painful, tourniquet, hammertoe, phalanx, head, incisional, tendon\nDescription:  Arthroplasty of the right second digit.

The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.  Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed.

The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.

Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used.  A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well.  Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position.  Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well.  At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed.  This was done without difficulty.  Attention was then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed.  After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose.  There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This was evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed.  Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block was then placed.  This aligned us to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made.  It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on.  This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur.  Once this was placed and pinned in position.  Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut.  It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects.  This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This was placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trials were removed.  The patella was then examined.  The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone.  It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed.  At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed.  There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet was then reinflated.  The canals were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial.  Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression.  This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This was then removed and the components were evaluated.  All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion.  The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity.  The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, knee arthroplasty, revision, zimmer nexgen, distal femoral, intramedullary guide, femoral component, femoral, knee, arthroplasty, intramedullary, patellar, medial, tibial, \nDescription:  Revision right total knee arthroplasty.

The medial epicondyle and the olecranon tip were well palpated.  The incision was initiated at equidistant between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle extending 3-4 cm proximally and 6-8 cm distally.  The ulnar nerve was identified proximally.  It was mobilized with a blunt and a sharp dissection proximally to the arcade of Struthers, which was released sharply.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.

The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.

The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.

The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.

A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.

Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he has elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complications include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures.  The skin was finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, renal mass, bovie, finochietto retractor, gerota's fascia, herniation, bulldog clamp, needle biopsy, nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, renal cell carcinoma, retroperitoneum, vicryl suture, gerota's, kidney, partial, renal, sutures, vicryl,\nDescription:  Left partial nephrectomy due to left renal mass."}]}

Third metatarsal osteotomy, right foot.,2.  Talus bunionectomy, right foot.,3.  Application of short-leg cast, right foot.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/local.,HISTORY:  ,This 31-year-old female presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal.  In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart.  She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She was counseled on smoking cessation.  She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.  She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d.  She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday.  She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot.

The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.,Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, an insulated 10-cm, 22-gauge needle with a 5-mm non-insulated stimulating tip was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique with PA views initially for orientation and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  For C3 to C6 medial branch RFTC's, the needles are placed along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch RFTC, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch RFTC, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.,Sensory stimulation was carried out at 50 Hz from 0 to 2.0 volts.  Stimulation was stopped once the maximum voltage was delivered or the patient either described a buzzing sensation indicating that it was a nonpainful nerve, or it caused replication of their concordant pain.  The stimulation was then changed to 2 Hz for motor stimulation and advanced up to 2.0 volts or until motor stimulation was found at that level.  If motor stimulation occurred, the needle was repositioned to abolish it but still cause concordant pain, or the RFTC was aborted at this level.,If the sensory stimulation caused concordant pain without motor stimulation, the area was then anesthetized with 1 cc of Marcaine 0.5% with 5 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate.  Once the anesthesia was established, a radiofrequency lesioning was then done at 65 degrees for 60 seconds.  The same procedure was carried out at all the affected levels.

The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: gastroenterology, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, liver disease, epigastric pain, liver cirrhosis, liver, abdominal, cirrhosis, epigastric, hepatitis,\nDescription:  Patient seen initially with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating."}]}

At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.

The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.

The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.

The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.,OBJECTIVE:  ,Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.,The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.,The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.,ORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:,  The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.

Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, intrauterine pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal heart tones, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal side wall laceration, fetal heart tones, vaginal delivery, vacuum assisted, laceration, intrauterine, tones, contractions, \nDescription:  Vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery of a third-degree midline laceration and right vaginal side wall laceration and repair of the third-degree midline laceration lasting for 25 minutes."}]}

He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.  He also had the NG tube in during that time.  On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued.  He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications.  At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control.  However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively.  After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA.  The PCA was discontinued.  He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently.  On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications.  His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications.  He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.,DISCHARGE CONDITION:,  Stable.,DISPOSITION: , Discharged to home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet.

There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus is normal appearing but slightly compressible.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appear normal.  There is evidence of endometriosis on the left pelvic sidewall in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was no endometriosis in the right pelvic sidewall or along the bladder flap.,There were some adhesions on the right abdominal sidewall from the previous appendectomy.  The liver margin, gallbladder, and bowel appeared normal.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A sharp curettage was performed until a gritty texture was noted in all aspects of the endometrium.  The moderate amount of tissue that was obtained was sent to Pathology.  The #20 Hank dilator was then replaced and the sterile speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  The Veress needle was placed into this incision and the gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  The #11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and a camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A Bierman needle was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline to allow a better visualization of the pelvic organs.  A 5 mm port was placed approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the right of the umbilicus and approximately 3 cm inferior.

She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month.  She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted.  Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month.  She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal.  I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time.

A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view.  This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen.  At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps.  I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no intraoperative complications.

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.

Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.

Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.

His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.  To review, his birth was unremarkable.  He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female.  He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade.  He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age.  It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep.  He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching.  His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere).  Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.,ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal.  He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures.  His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication.  That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes.  He has done well otherwise.  Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration.  He has not had any behavior issues.  He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities.  He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents.  Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms.  Mother is an 8th grade teacher.,Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known.  There is no other relevant family history.,Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation.  This is perhaps due to sports injury.  He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted.  He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities.  He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills.  He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints.,Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.,Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress.

Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006.  The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal.  At that time, he will be tapered off of medication.  I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication.  For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him.  There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased.  Family understands the plan.  We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months.  Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results.,Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: neurology, tonic-clonic seizures, benign rolandic epilepsy, rolandic epilepsy, epilepsy, seizures, electroencephalogram,\nDescription:  Diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy."}]}

The patient is a diabetic who requires insulin, but has been noncompliant and states that his blood sugars have been out of control.  He has had a groin abdominal wound drained for about four days.  The patient states that there has been pus that has saturated his sheath.  He has had a possible fever at home that he did not chart with a thermometer.  He has had the same groin infection twice in the past with tunneling lesions.  The patient states that his wife noted there was a round scar on his abdomen and that was black and had crept up in the last day.  Bowel habits and eating were essentially normal.,Urinary habits were normal.  The patient is morbidly obese and is approximately 450 lb.  He has not been following a diabetic diet or using insulin secondary to lack of funds to put his medications.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Diabetes, morbid obesity, and nephrolithiasis.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Appendectomy and stone extraction.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was examined in the Emergency Room by Dr. X and was found to have multiple areas of erythematous tissue, which could potentially be consistent with a necrotizing fascitis texture.  The patient had a white count of 11.4 and a hemoglobin of 13.4.  Please note that the patient is a Jehovah's Witness and has adamantly refused receiving any blood products.  The risks and benefits of such were discussed with the patient at length prior to surgery and he was permitted to make sure not to receive blood and his wishes will be granted.  In the operative suite, he was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was placed in a lithotomy position to visualize the peritoneum as well as the abdomen.  Copious amounts of Betadine solution were used to cleanse the area and the wound was visualized.  Approximately, 10 cm x 5 cm elliptical incision was made on the lower left quadrant of the abdomen surrounding the area of necrosis.  Necrotic tissue comprised approximately 2 cm x 2 cm area and was indurated.  The abdomen appeared to have a large erythematous border, however, the true indurated tissue was approximately the size of a deck of cards.  The area was incised using a #10 blade scalpel and then Bovie cauterization was used to achieve good hemostasis.  The tissue was removed using an Allis forceps as well as a Bovie to double the incision down to the fascia.  The necrotic tissue was lifted out of the abdomen.  All bleeding was cauterized using the Bovie.  A solution of gentamicin and sterile saline was placed into a high-powered water pump device and the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned.  A wet Kerlix dressing was passed into the wound and it will be left opened with wet-to-dry dressing.  The left groin area was also incised using an elliptical incision that was approximately 13 cm x 6 cm.  The tissue was incised to the muscle layer of the muscle.  There was a pus pocket that was visible with capsule as well and there was an area of the necrotic tissue as well.  There was a mild amount of pus that drained from the wound.  Cultures were taken from the groin wound and were sent to pathology.  The specimen was excised using traction with the Allis clamps as well as Bovie set on coag.  Once the tissue was excised from the ________, the area was fully irrigated using the gentamicin sterile saline solution in the high-powered water irrigation unit.  After the irrigation, the wound was packed using a wet Kerlix dressing and will be left open to heal.,It was determined at this time that both wounds will be left open to heal with the wet-to-dry dressings in place and we will come back and close the wounds at a later date.  The skin excised from the left lower abdominal quadrant as well as the left groin was sent to pathology.

The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.

Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.  She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor.  Previous orders will be resumed.

Nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately and secured.  The previous skin incision for a thyroidectomy was then planned, then incorporated into an ellipse.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, the ellipse around the previous incision was deformed.  The scar was then excised.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal notch respectively.  Strap muscles were isolated in the midline and dissected and mobilized from the thyroid lobe on the right side.  There was some dense fibrosis and inflammation surrounding the right thyroid lobe.  Careful dissection along the thyroid lobe allowed for identification of the superior thyroid artery and vein which were individually ligated with a Harmonic scalpel.  The right inferior and superior parathyroid glands were identified and preserved and recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and traced superiorly, then preserved.  Of note is that there were multiple lymph nodes in the paratracheal region on the right side.  These lymph nodes were carefully dissected away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, and the carotid artery, and sent as a separate specimen labeled right paratracheal lymph nodes.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  Surgicel was placed in the wound bed.  Strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline with 3-0 Vicryl and incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.

The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.

I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.,Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.

She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week\u2019s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.

The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings.

Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS:,  Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital.  This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticularly, the joint was observed.  There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear.  The biceps complex was otherwise intact.  There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint.  Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface.  Subacromially, the same was true.  This was an elliptical to V-type tear.  The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  He was safely placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion.  Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum.  The biceps was probed and noted to be intact.  Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment.,After this, instrumentation was removed.  The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters.  An anterolateral portal was created.  Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire.  With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.  Superolateral portal was then created.  A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone.  _______ suture was placed.  The implant was put into place.  The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory.,Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie.  A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion.,After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint.  Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements.  A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length.  0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

Limited exploratory laparotomy with removal of foreign body and lysis of adhesions.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Under general endotracheal anesthesia, first of all the patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus and the left gluteal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The opening of the abscess was probed and there was a tract of about 20 cm going subcutaneously upward.  I proceeded to enlarge the drainage area and to some degree unroofing the tract partially and then the area was d\u00e9brided and then packed with iodoform gauze and a temporary dressing was applied.,Then, the patient was placed in a supine position, and I proceeded to remove the pigtail catheter after dividing it to undo its locking mechanism.  It came out without any difficulty.  Then, the colostomy was protected and draped apart, and the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  My initial idea was to just drain and debride the wound infection, which had a sinus tract at lower end of the midline incision.  I initially probed the wound with a hemostat and this had at least 12 cm long tract and I proceeded to excise the badly scarred skin that was on top of it and then continued the dissection to the fascia and I realized that the sinus tract was going through the fascia into the abdomen.  Very carefully, I started dividing the fascia.  Of course, there were several small bowel loops adhered to the area.  The dissection was quite tedious for a while.  Initially, I thought that may be there was an enterocutaneous fistula in the area, but then I realized that the tissue that was interpreted as an intestinal mucosa was actually a very smooth __________ tissue that was walling the sinus tract.  I made a laparotomy of about 10 cm and I carefully dissected the bowel of the fascia.  There was an area at the bottom which looked like a foreign body and initially I thought there was a mesh that can be used to close the abdomen, but later on this substance floated out by self and it was an elongated strip, maybe about 6 cm, which we sent to Pathology for examination.  Initially, I have obtained a sample for culture and sensitivity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms.,I was very happy that we were not really dealing with enterocutaneous fistula.  The area was irrigated generously with saline and then we closed the fascia with number of interrupted figure-of-eight sutures of heavy PPS.  The subcutaneous tissue and the skin were left open and packed with Betadine-soaked sponges.,A dressing was applied.  A small dressing was applied to the area where we removed the pigtail catheter and also we went down to the gluteal area and put a formal dressing in that area.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today\u2019s reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.

This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, bactiseal, bactiseal catheter, codman bactiseal, blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt, ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt revision, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, catheter, ventriculoperitoneal, ventricular, shunt\nDescription:  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end."}]}

It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain.  He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5.  Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease.  He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.,The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin.  The needle was removed and a pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis.  The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter.  The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was carefully engaged and using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary artery was evaluated in both diagonal views.

The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today\u2019s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.

Her adnexa is within normal limits.  The patient and I had a long discussion.  Consent was reviewed in layman's terms.  The patient understood the foreseeable risks and complications, the alternative treatments and procedure itself and recovery.  Questions were answered.  The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  The patient underwent pelvic examination and then carefully placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had excellent femoral pulses and there was no excessive extension or hyperflexion of the lower extremities.  The patient's history is that she is at risk for development of condyloma.  The patient's husband was found to have a laryngeal papillomatosis.  She has had a laparotomy, which is an infraumbilical incision appendectomy, a laparoscopy, and bilateral tubal ligation.  Her uterus appears to be mobile by 12-week size.  There is a good descend.  There appears to be no adnexal abnormalities.  Uterus is 12-week sized and has fibroids, it is boggy and probably has a component of adenomyosis.  The patient's cervix was dilated without difficulty utilizing Circon ACMI hysteroscope with a 12-degree lens.  The patient underwent hysteroscopy.  The outflow valve was opened at all times.  The inflow valve was opened just to achieve appropriate distension.  The patient did have no evidence of trauma of the cervix.  No Trendelenburg as we were in room #9.  The patient also had the bag held two fingerbreadths above the level of the heart.  The patient was seen.  There is a 2 x 3 cm focal thickening of the posterior wall of the uterus' endometrial lining, a more of a polypoid nature.  The patient also has one in the fundal area.  The thickened tissue was removed via sharp curettage.  Therefore, we reinserted the hysteroscope.

She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled \"pre-excision.\"  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.

Attempted laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,3.  Open laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 62-year-old female with a history of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction with chronic indwelling double-J ureteral stent.  The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: pain management, carpal tunnel syndrome, pulley, dupuytren's, tenosynovitis, tenosynovectomy, carpal tunnel release, flexor tenosynovectomy, cortisone injection, dupuytren's nodule, injection, cortisone,\nDescription:  Left carpal tunnel release with flexor tenosynovectomy; cortisone injection of trigger fingers, left third and fourth fingers; injection of Dupuytren's nodule, left palm."}]}

The patient had good support in the anterior vagina and in the posterior vagina but had significant apical prolapse.  Options such as watchful waiting, pessary, abdominal surgery, robotic sacrocolpopexy versus open sacrocolpopexy were discussed.,The patient already had multiple abdominal scars.  Risk of open surgery was little bit higher for the patient.  After discussing the options the patient wanted to proceed a Pfannenstiel incision and repair of the sacrocolpopexy.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, mesh erogenic exposure, complications with mesh were discussed.  The patient understood the risks of recurrence, etc, and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told to perform no heavy lifting for 3 months, etc.  The patient was bowel prepped, preoperative antibiotics were given.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel low abdominal incision was done at the old incision site.  The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia and the fascia was lifted off the rectus abdominus muscle.  The muscle was split in the middle and peritoneum was entered using sharp mets.  There was no injury to the bowel upon entry.  There were significant adhesions which were unleashed.  All the adhesions in the sigmoid colon from the right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant were released, similarly colon was mobilized.  There was minimal space, everything was packed, Bookwalter placed then over the sacral bone.  The middle of the sacral bone was identified.  The right ureter was clearly identified and was lateral to where the posterior peritoneum was opened.  The ligament over the sacral or sacral __________ was easily identified, 0 Ethibond stitches were placed x3.  A 1 cm x 5 cm mesh was cut out.  This was a Prolene soft mesh which was tied at the sacral ligament.  The bladder was clearly off the vault area which was exposed, in the raw surface 0 Ethibond stitches were placed x3.  The mesh was attached.  The apex was clearly up enterocele sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl without much difficulty.  The ureter was not involved at all in this process.  The peritoneum was closed over the mesh.  Please note that the peritoneum was opened and it was brought around and over the mesh so that the mesh would not be exposed to the bowel.  Prior to closure antibiotic irrigation was done using Ancef solution.  The mesh has been exposed in antibiotic solution prior to the usage.,After a through irrigation with L and half of antibiotic solution.  All the solution was removed.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  All the packing was removed.  Count was correct.  Rectus abdominus muscle was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in running fascia from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure.  Please note that the Foley was in place throughout the entire procedure which was placed thoroughly at the beginning of the procedure.  Cystoscopy was done and indigo carmine has been given.  There was good efflux of indigo carmine in both of the ureteral opening.  There was no injury to the rectum or the bladder.  The bladder appeared completely normal.

The fetal heart tones did start and it continued to have variable decelerations with contractions overall are reassuring.  The contraction pattern was inadequate.  It was discussed with the patient's family that in light of the physical exam and with the fetal malpresentation that a cesarean section will be recommended.  All the questions were answered.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with a leftward tilt.  Prior to this, the spinal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was then prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was then grasped with Ochsners, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The superior portion and inferior portion of the rectus fascia was identified, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was then identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then gently stretched.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with an Allis and the bladder flap was created bluntly as well as using Metzenbaum scissors.  The uterus was entered with the second scalpel and large transverse incision.  This was then extended in upward and lateral fashion bluntly.  The infant was then delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were suctioned.  The cord was then clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  The placenta was then manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then repaired using #0 chromic in a running fashion marking a U stitch.  A second layer of the same suture was used in an imbricating fashion to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was then returned to the anatomical position.  The abdomen and the gutters were cleared of all clots.  Again, the incision was found to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The rectus fascia was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion locking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.

Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.

The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.

Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting.,4. Right femoral artery angiography.,5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring.,TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE:, Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation.

The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords:  \nDescription:  Diagnostic operative arthroscopy with repair and reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using autologous hamstring tendon, a 40 mm bioabsorbable femoral pin, and a 9 mm bioabsorbable tibial pin.

He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  All staples were removed from the Integra and the adherent areas of Silastic were removed.  The entire wound bed was further prepped with scrub brushes and more Betadine followed by a sulfamylon solution.  Hemostasis of the wound bed was ensured using epinephrine-soaked Telfa pads.  Following dermal tumescence of the buttocks, epidermal autografts were harvested 8 one-thousandths of an inch using the air Zimmer dermatome.  These grafts were passed to the back table where they were meshed 3:1.  The donor sites were hemostased using epinephrine-soaked Telfa and lap pads.  Once all the  grafts were meshed, we brought them back up onto the field, positioned them over the wounds beginning inferiorly and moving cephalad where we had best areas of Integra engraftment.

A suture was placed through the guidewire, and the guidewire and dilator were removed.  The arterial catheter was then placed through this, and the tear-away introducer was removed.  The catheter aspirated and bled easily.  It was flushed with saline and capped.  This was repeated with the venous line.  It also aspirated easily and was flushed with saline and capped.  The neck incision was closed with a 4-0 Tycron, and the catheters were sutured at the exit sites with 4-0 nylon.  Dressings were applied.  An incision was then made at the left wrist.  The basilic vein was dissected free, as was the radial artery.  Heparin was given, 50 mg.  The radial artery was clamped proximally and distally with a bulldog.  It was opened with a #11 blade and Potts scissors, and stay sutures of 5-0 Prolene were placed.  The vein was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  It was sutured to the radial artery with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The clamps were removed.  Good flow was noted through the artery.  Protamine was given, and the wound was closed with interrupted 3-0 Dexon subcutaneous and a running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin.

A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.,The transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.,The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.,First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.,The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.,At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: gastroenterology, inferior left renal artery, semi continuous prolene suture, juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, inferior mesenteric artery, continuous prolene suture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hemashield tube, inferior mesenteric, renal artery, aortic aneurysm, aneurysm, iliac, endarterectomy, viscera, hemashield, abdomen, prolene, arteries, juxtarenal, graft, aortic, endotracheal, renal, artery, \nDescription:  Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft."}]}

Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.

It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.

I think her stress reactions to these as far as feeling frustrated are within normal limits.  We did complete a mini mental state exam including clock drawing, sentence writing, signature, etc.  She does score a maximum score of 30/30 and all other tasks were completed without difficulty or any hesitation.  I did spend quite a bit of time reassuring her as well.  She is currently on Zoloft 100 mg which I think is an appropriate dose.  We will have her continue on that.  She did verbalize understanding and that she actually felt better after our discussion concerning these issues.  At some point in time; however, I would possibly recommend job change if this one would persist as far as the stress levels.  She is going to think about that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: general medicine, short-term memory loss, anxiety, short term memory loss, memory loss, stress issues, situational, memory, stress, \nDescription:  Short-term memory loss (probable situational) and anxiety stress issues."}]}

He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords:  \nDescription:  Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma.

He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.

Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.,2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,HISTORY: , This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.,2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.

Mitral valve repair using a quadrangular resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet.,2.  Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a \"tissue pledget\" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Open reduction and internal fixation of right distal radius fracture - intraarticular four piece fracture.,2.  Right carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,CLINICAL SUMMARY: , The patient is a 37-year-old right-hand dominant Hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago.  This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally.  In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop.  She is admitted for reconstructive operation.  The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury.,OPERATION:,  The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity.  The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing.  The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification.  At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally.  This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly.  The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles.  The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin.  It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced.  This was an intraarticular four-part fracture.  Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced.  Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  The fracture was then manipulated.  The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it.  Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment.  A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires.  At this time, the distal screws were then placed.  The distal screws were the small screws.  These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed.  They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth.  Again, these were 18-20 mm screws.  After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires.  There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture.  After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit.  The screws were then placed.  These were 12 mm screws.  They were placed 4 in number.  The K-wires were then removed.  Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist.  This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure.  It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation.  The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed.  The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm.  In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon.  Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery.  The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion.  A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position.  The tourniquet was let down.  The fingers were immediately pink.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no operative complications.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.

Excision of nerve lesion in the left third interspace.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored IV sedation with local.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 37-year-old female who presents to ABCD's preoperative holding area, n.p.o. since mid night, last night for surgery of her painful left second and third interspaces and her left fifth metatarsal.  The patient has attempted conservative correction and injections with minimal improvement.  The patient desires surgical correction at this time.  The patient states that her pain has been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes.  At this time, the patient desires surgical intervention and correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.,Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied around her left ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose was administered to the patient for local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and a tourniquet was then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage.  The foot was then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet was draped.  The stockinet was then reflected.  Attention was then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace.  After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision was placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsals distally to and beyond the metatarsal head.  Then, using #15 blade the incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures.  Incision was deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade.  The incision was deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which was reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space was appreciated.  The individual branches of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digits plantarly.  These endings were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions.  Following this, the nerve was dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space.  Using careful meticulous dissection, there was noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fibers and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue.  This was also cut and removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve stump was identified and care was taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed.  Following this, the interspace was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portions of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection.  It was noted that no other portions of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending was embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly.  Following this, the interspace was packed using iodoform gauze packing and was closed in layers with the packing extruding from the wound.  Attention was then directed to the third interspace where in a manner as mentioned before.  A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm was made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head.  Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision was deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structures which were encountered.,The incision was deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal.  The dissection was deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this was reflected and the nerve fibers to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified.  These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions.  Care was then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region.  No other branches of the nerve were identified and the nerve in its entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area was removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve which remained was not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle as was done in the previous interspace.  Half of the nerve was transected proximally as was feasible and no exposed ending was noted.  Incision was then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline.  Following this, the incision wound was packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layers using as before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture.,Following this, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision was placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade.  The incision was then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect any neurovascular structures which were encountered.  Following this the incision was deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum was reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region.  After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head was achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane was performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal was shifted medially.  Following this, an OrthoSorb pin was retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and was cut off first with the lateral surfaces of bone.  OrthoSorb pin was noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head was in good alignment and position.  Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edges of bone laterally.  Following this, the periosteum was closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in layers using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture.  Upon completion of this, the foot was noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit.  The incisions in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage.  The tourniquet was then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minutes at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to end digits one through five of the left foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The patient was then given prescriptions for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily.  The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office.  The patient also given postoperative instructions and was placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minutes every hour as tolerated.  The patient also instructed to take her medications and prescriptions as directed.  She was given the emergency contact numbers.  Postoperative x-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home in stable condition upon conclusion of this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: orthopedic, tailor's bunion, neuroma, nerve lesion, interspace, metatarsal, osteotomy, metatarsal osteotomy, metatarsal head, foot, distally, head, incision, nerve, intermetatarsal, portions,\nDescription:  Tailor's bunionectomy with metatarsal osteotomy of the left fifth metatarsal.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.

Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.

The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can't\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.

Nasal endoscopy.,2.  Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: ent - otolaryngology, nasal cavity, joseph elevator, squamous cell carcinoma, endoscopy, intranasally, maxilla, nasal ala, nasal tip, rhinectomy, septorhinoplasty, nasal endoscopy, lateral cartilage, frozen section, additional soft, squamous cell, cell carcinoma, nasal, cartilage, squamous, carcinoma, cavity, tissue \nDescription:  Nasal endoscopy and partial rhinectomy due to squamous cell carcinoma, left nasal cavity."}]}

He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.  The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.

Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, prostate cancer, foley catheter, gleason, psa, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder neck, core biopsy, figure-of-eight, lymph node dissection, nerve-sparing, prostatectomy, rectus fascia, retropubic, bladder neck dissection, dorsal vein complex, nerve sparing, perirectal fat, seminal vesicles, sutures, bladder, urethra, posteriorly, seminal, vesicles, fascia, neck, dissection,\nDescription:  Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection."}]}

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to elevate the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using the Bovie.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.,The peritoneum was identified and entered using Metzenbaum scissors; this incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and entered sharply using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was reinserted.  The lower uterine segment was incised in a transverse fashion using the scalpel and extended using bandage scissors as well as manual traction.,Clear fluid was noted.  The infant was subsequently delivered using a Kelly vacuum due to anteflexed head and difficulty in delivering the infant's head without the Kelly.  The nose and mouth were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was subsequently handed to the awaiting nursery nurse.  The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord noted.

The patient began having prodromal symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to presentation.  She was seen on 03/09/2007 and a nonstress test was performed.  This revealed some spontaneous variable-appearing decelerations.  She was given IV hydration.  A biophysical profile was obtained, which provided a score of 0/8 with only a 1 cm fluid pocket found.  Therefore, she was admitted for further fetal monitoring and evaluation.  She had changed her cervix from closed 2 days prior to presentation to 1 cm dilated.  She was having somewhat irregular contractions, but with stronger contractions, continued to have decelerations to 50 to 60 beats per minute.  Due to these findings, a scalp electrode was placed as well as an IUPC for an amnioinfusion.  This relieved the decelerations somewhat.  However, over a period of time with strong contractions, she still had bradycardia 40 to 50 beats per minute and developed a late component on the return of the decelerations.  Due to this finding, it was evident that the fetal state would not support labor in order to accomplish a vaginal delivery.  These findings were reviewed with the patient and recommendation was made for cesarean section delivery.  The risks and benefits of this surgery were reviewed, and knowing these facts, the patient gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where her epidural anesthesia was reinforced.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate epidural level was confirmed, the scalp was utilized to make a transverse incision in the patient's lower abdominal wall.  This incision was carried down to the level of the fascia, which was also transversely incised.  After adequate hemostasis, the fascia was bluntly and sharply separated up from the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in midline exposing the peritoneum.  The peritoneum was carefully grasped and elevated with hemostats.  It was entered in an up and down fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The bladder blade was placed in the lower pole of the incision to protect the bladder.,The uterus was palpated and inspected.  A thin lower uterine segment was noted.  The vertex presentation was confirmed.  The scalp was then utilized to make a transverse or Kerr incision in the lower uterine wall.  Clear fluid was noted upon entering into the amniotic space.  At 05:27, a term viable female infant was delivered up through the incision.  She had spontaneous respirations.  She was given bulb suctioning for clear fluid.  Her cord was clamped and cut and she was delivered off the field to Dr. X who was attending.  The baby girl was subsequently signed Apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.  Her birth weight was found to be 5 pounds and 5 ounces.,The placenta was manually extracted from the endometrial cavity.  A ring clamp and two Allis clamps were placed around the margin of the uterine incision for hemostasis.  The uterus was delivered up into the operative field.  The endometrial cavity was swiped clean with a moist laparotomy pad.  The uterine incision was then closed in a two-layered fashion with 0 Vicryl suture, the first layer interlocking and the second layer imbricating.  Two additional stitches of 3-0 Vicryl suture were utilized for hemostasis.  The uterine incision was noted to be hemostatic upon closure.  The uterus was rotated forward, normal tubes and ovaries were noted on both sides.  The uterus was then returned to its normal position of the abdominal cavity.  The sponge and instrument count was performed for the first time at this point and found to be correct.  The pelvis and anterior uterine space was then irrigated with saline solution.  It was suctioned dry.  A final check of the uterine incision confirmed hemostasis.  The rectus muscle was stabilized across the midline with two simple stitches of 0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous tissue was then exposed, and the fascia closed with two running lengths of 0 Vicryl suture, beginning in lateral margins and overlapping the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was then irrigated and inspected.  No active bleeding was noted.  It was closed with a running length of 3-0 plain catgut suture.  The skin was then approximated with surgical steel staples.  The incision was infiltrated with a 0.5% solution of Marcaine local anesthetic.  The incision was cleansed and sterilely dressed.,The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The estimated blood loss through the procedure was 450 mL.

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.

The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, hallux abductovalgus deformity, scarf bunionectomy, metatarsal, bunion, hallux abductovalgus, metatarsophalangeal joint, dorsally, foot, bone, abductovalgus \nDescription:  Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.

The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: neurosurgery, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor\nDescription:  Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty."}]}

Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.

This is secondary to a motor vehicle accident and it was translated appropriately 1 cm.  Risks and benefits have been conferred with the patient as well as the family, they wish to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room for a C1-C3 posterior cervical fusion, instrumentation, open reduction and internal fixation.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #5.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated and under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  Spinal cord monitoring was induced.  No changes were seen from the beginning to the end of the case.,Mayfield tongues were placed appropriately.  This was placed in line with the pinna of the ear as well as a cm above the tip of the earlobes.  The patient was subsequently rolled onto the fluoroscopic OSI table in the usual prone position with chest rolls.  The patient's Mayfield tongue was fixated in the usual standard fashion.  The patient was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Midline incision was extended from the base of the skull down to the C4 spinous process.  Full thickness skin fascia developed.  The fascia was incised at midline and the posterior elements at C1, C2, C3, as well as the inferior aspect of the occiput was exposed.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed the level to be C2.,Translaminar screws were placed at C2 bilaterally.  Trajectory was completed with a hand drill and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of pedicles and once this was done, two 3.5 mm translaminar screws were placed bilaterally at C2.  Good placement was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Facet screws were then placed at C3.  Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.  No significant bleeding was appreciated.  The patient was subsequently extubated uneventfully and taken back to the recovery room in satisfactory and stable condition.

Mom reported history of high fever after surgery and he has one seizure previously.  He has history of trauma to his front teeth and physician put him on antibiotics.  He was only cooperative for having me do a visual examination on his anterior teeth.  Visual examination revealed severe dental caries and dental abscess from tooth #E and his maxillary anterior teeth needed to be extracted.  Due to his young age and hemophilia, I felt that he would be best served to be taken to the hospital operating room.,OTHER PREPARATION:  ,The child was brought to the Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by his mother.  There, I met with her and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks, and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all her questions and concerns were addressed, she gave her informed consent to proceed with treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  He was given factor for appropriately for his hemophilia prior to being taken back to the operating room.  Once he was cleared by Anesthesia, the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with an oral tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiograph.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.,Prophylaxis was then performed using a prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The patient's teeth were rinsed well.  The patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examination followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were incidentally removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries removal was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm and sound dentin.,Teeth restored with composite ___________  bonded with a one-step bonding agent.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.  The caries were extensive and invaded the pulp tissues, pulp therapy was initiated using ViscoStat and then IRM pulpotomies.  Teeth treated in such a manner would then be crowned with stainless steel crowns.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.  At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, was taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis, secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental carries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth B, OL caries, tooth C, M, L, S caries, tooth B, caries on all surfaces, tooth E caries on all surfaces, tooth F caries on all surfaces, tooth T caries on all surfaces, tooth H, lingual and facial caries, tooth I, caries on all surfaces, tooth L caries on all surfaces, and tooth S, all caries.

Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned.

The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.

After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact.  The screws were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.  All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time.  The left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.,The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.  The patient was also given pain medications, instructions on how to control his postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for his first postoperative appointment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: surgery, hardware removal, metatarsal osteotomy, painful hardware, osteotomy, excision of nonunion, corticocancellous bone graft, internal fixation, subcutaneous tissues, previous osteotomy, vicryl suture, suture material, corticocancellous bone, ankle tourniquet, bone graft, metatarsal, tourniquet, allograft, fixation, plates, ankle, vicryl, nonunion, screws, \nDescription:  Removal of painful hardware, first left metatarsal.

His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.

There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: consult - history and phy., lethargy, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, shunted hydrocephalus, seizure breakthrough, shunt malfunction, neurologic consultation, neurologic, seizure, trileptal\nDescription:  Neurologic consultation was requested to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy."}]}

Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient was placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tones were checked and were 140s, and she was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia was nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia was grasped, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade was inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum was tented up and a bladder flap was created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade was reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision was extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid was noted.  Infant's head was in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant was delivered atraumatically.  The infant was very pale upon delivery.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube was doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gases were obtained.  Cord was then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood was drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it was noted that the cord was significantly yellow stained as well as the placenta.  At this time, the placenta was delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus was exteriorized and cleared off all clots and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment was closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two areas of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight sutures were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision was hemostatic.  The bladder was examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovaries were examined and found to be normal.  The patient was again asked if she desires permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube was identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube was doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis was noted.  Then, attention was turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion was grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Attention was returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus was returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clots and debris.  Lower uterine segments were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum was grasped with Kelly clamps x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation was used.  Rectus muscle belly was examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation was again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x3 and the patient was sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.

The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.

She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.  The scope was slowly withdrawn.  The GE junction was unremarkable.  The scope was fully withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.

Subacromial space was entered.  Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene.  Sterile compressive dressing applied.,The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep.,The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes.  Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,Cautery was used for hemostasis.  The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords:  \nDescription:  Right shoulder arthroscopy, subacromial decompression, distal clavicle excision, bursectomy, and coracoacromial ligament resection, carpal tunnel release, left knee arthroscopy, and partial medial and lateral meniscectomy."}]}

The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.

The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.

There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder was easily visualized.  There was an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought into the operating suite.,After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum was smooth.  The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion.  Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It was done without difficulty.

He had a history of injection of heroin into his bilateral thighs.  Unfortunately, he developed chronic abscesses, open wounds on his bilateral thighs, much worse on his right than his left.  Decision was made to do a radical excision and then it is followed by reconstruction.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted on 03/05/08 by Dr. X.  He was taken to the operating room.  He underwent a massive resection of multiple subcutaneous abscesses, heroin remnants, which left massive huge open wounds to his right thigh and hip.  This led to a prolonged hospital course.  The patient initially was treated with local wound care.  He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.  He ended up growing out different species of Clostridium.  Infectious Disease consult was obtained from Dr. Z.  He assisted in further antibiotic coverage throughout the rest of his hospitalization.  The patient also had significant hypoalbuminemia, decreased nutrition.  Given his large wounds, he did end up getting a feeding tube placement, and prior to grafting, he received significant feeding tube supplementation to help achieve adequate nutrition for healing.  The patient had this superior area what appeared to be further necrotic, infected soft tissue.  He went back to the OR on 03/16/08 and further resection done by Dr. X.  After this, his wound appeared to be free of infection.  He is treated with a wound VAC.  He slowly, but progressively had significant progress in his wound.  I went from a very poor-looking wound to a red granulated wound throughout its majority.  He was thought ready for skin grafting.  Note that the patient had serial ultrasounds given his high risk of DVT from this massive wound and need for decreased activity.  These were negative.  He was treated with SCDs to help decrease his risk.  On 04/01/08, the patient was taken to the operating room, was thought to have an adequate ________ grafting.  He underwent skin grafting to his right thigh and hip massive open wound.  Donor sites were truncated.  Postoperatively, the patient ended up with a vast majority of skin graft taking.  To unable to take, he was kept on IV antibiotics, strict bed rest, and limited range of motion of his hip.  He is continued on VAC dressing.  Graft progressively improved with this therapy.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.

The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.

The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.

Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.

She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.

Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

The pain has started in the umbilical area and radiated to McBurney's point.  The patient appears to have a significant pain requiring surgical evaluation.  It did not appear that the pain was pelvic in nature, but more higher up in the abdomen, more towards the appendix.  The patient was seen by Dr. Y at my request in the ER with me in attendance.  We went over the case.  He decided that she should go to the operating room for evaluation and to have appendix evaluated and probably removed.  The patient on ultrasound had a 0.9 cm ovarian cyst on the right side.  The patient's cyst was not completely simple and they are concerns over the possibility of an abnormality.  The patient states that she has had chlamydia in the past, but it was not a pelvic infection more vaginal infection.  The patient has had hospitalization for this.  The patient therefore signed informed in layman's terms with her understanding that perceivable risks and complications, the alternative treatment, the procedure itself and recovery.  All questions were answered.  ,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was seen in the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room, there is really no apparent vaginal discharge.  No odor or cervical motion tenderness.  Negative bladder sweep.  Adnexa were without abnormalities.  In the OR, we were able to perform pelvic examination showing a slightly enlarged fibroid uterus about 9 to 10-week size.  The patient had no adnexal fullness.  The patient then underwent an insertion of a uterine manipulator and Dr. X was in the case at that time and he started the laparoscopic process i.e., inserting the laparoscope.  We then observed under direct laparoscopic visualization with the aid of a camera that there was pus in and around the uterus.  The both fallopian tubes were seen.  There did not appear to be hydrosalpinx.  The ovaries were seen.  The left showed some adhesions into the ovarian fossa.  The cul-de-sac had a banded adhesions.  The patient on the right adnexa had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, where the cyst was only about a centimeter enlarged.  The ovary did not appear to have pus in it, but there was pus over the area of the bladder flap.  The patient's bowel was otherwise unremarkable.  The liver contained evidence of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and prior PID.  The appendix was somewhat adherent into the retrocecal area and to the mid-quadrant abdominal sidewall on the right.  The case was then turned over to Dr. Y who was in the room at that time and Dr. X had left.  The patient's case was turned over to him.  Dr. Y was performed an appendectomy following which cultures and copious irrigation.  Dr. Y was then closed the case.  The patient was placed on antibiotics.

Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.

As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.

The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: neurosurgery, coronal synostosis, syndromic craniosynostosis, craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, fronto-orbital bar, cranial vault reconstruction, cranial vault, orbital bar, orbital, cranial,\nDescription:  Anterior cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital bar advancement."}]}

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips.  Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made.  Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct.  After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography.  The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery.  Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.,Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.

Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.

He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.

The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it.  There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was placed in supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision.  Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg.  The Veress needle was then removed.  A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen.  A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation.  Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation.  Photodocumentation was obtained.,A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant.  This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix.  Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization.  Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix.  Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix.  Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples.  Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure.  Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it.  The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site.  The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated.  The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic.  Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear.  There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site.  This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty.  There was no evidence of other areas of disease.

Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: endocrinology, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage\nDescription:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.
